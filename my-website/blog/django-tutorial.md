Have you been learning the basics of Django and looking for a simple yet practical project to build so you can put your knowledge into practice? If yes, then you have found a goldmine.

This tutorial series will walk you through several Django project ideas for beginners with source code. That way, you are not just learning Django concepts but also building real-world projects with it and stacking up your portfolio in the process—a win-win if you think about it.

In this first series, you will build a simple blog website using Django. With this project, you will learn how to route URLs, load static files, and pass dynamic data to templates (HTML) in Django.

Don’t worry if any of these concepts sound unfamiliar to you. Ignore them for now and focus more on understanding the steps in this guide, as I will explain them in the easiest way possible.
Hint: Ensure you code along so you get to understand better.

Before we get into it, ensure you have the following:
A code editor installed on your device. E.g., VSCode
Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
Without any further ado, let’s get into it and build a super-powerful blog website!
